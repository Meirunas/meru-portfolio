    "bio": "I am a front-end developer with around four years of experience building web and iOS solutions, internal tools, and marketing assets. I have also created and maintained both static and interactive websites, with a strong focus on responsive design and performance. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from a renowned London University. During my studies, I completed several full-stack and front-end projects, including a dynamic charity website and a full e-commerce platform. I launched a frontend dev hub to share my experience and improve my teamwork skills. In addition, I have been following clientsâ€™ requirements created on Adobe applications, such as InDesign and XD. With over 14 years in IT environments I built a wide range of skills, including HTML, CSS, JS, TS, React and Vue, that can benefit your company.",
